## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of various advanced data structures in C and C++. Each data structure is accompanied by a comprehensive set of tests to ensure robustness and correctness.

## Data Structures Implemented

- **HashMap(Probing, Chaining)**: An efficient key-value storage with O(1) average time complexity.
- **[LinkedList]**: Brief description.
- *(Add more as you implement them)*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern C/C++ compiler (e.g., `gcc`, `g++`, `clang`).
- `make` utility (Optional, if you provide Makefile).

### Compilation

To compile the data structures:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -o output_file source_file.cpp

```xcode
import to Xcode.
